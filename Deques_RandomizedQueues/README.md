# Deques and Randomized Queues
Week 2 assignment for course Algorithm, Part I

See https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php for details. The codes use functions from ``edu.princeton.cs.algs4``.
The permutation problem uses randomized queue data structure for permutation. However, it misses the bonus tests for limiting the size of queue or deque by the required output size only. This is to be resovled.
